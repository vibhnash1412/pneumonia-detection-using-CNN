# pneumonia-detection-using-CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it helps classify X-rays into Normal and Pneumonia categories.
